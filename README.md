# üîß Hyperparameter Tuning on Classification Case

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates how to perform **hyperparameter tuning** on various classification models using a binary classification dataset. The goal is to evaluate and improve model performance through systematic tuning using Scikit-Learn's `GridSearchCV`.

---

## üìö Dataset

- The dataset used involves a binary classification task (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LVIEzGbnuvHUKPVCZpifk_fPelQ6Wdy-/view?usp=sharing)
- The target variable contains two classes: `0` and `1`.
- It is assumed the dataset is pre-cleaned: no missing values, no categorical encoding required.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Train and evaluate baseline classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

- Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` for fine-tuning.

- Evaluate model performance using Recall score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80:20)
   - Apply feature scaling using `StandardScaler` where needed

2. **Baseline Modeling**
   - Train and evaluate each model with default hyperparameters
   - Select the top-performing model for tuning

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Conduct randomized search for initial tuning
   - Follow with grid search for best hyperparameter combination

4. **Final Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the tuned model using metrics and visualization
   - Compare results with the baseline model

## üìä Key Results

- The models showed significant improvement after tuning (better Recall Score).
- The models without tuning exhibit signs of overfitting, as seen in the high recall on the training set, which drops significantly when applied to the validation and test sets.
